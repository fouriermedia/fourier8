										<h1>Ethics and Guidelines</h1>

									<p>Fourier is a part of HIMATIKA ITB which wallows in the cyber media field. We aim to disseminate the beauty of math to as many crowds as possible. We will work hard to help people identify math in their everyday life and help them see it in a satisfying way instead of horrifying. We believe and we know that math is more than calculating, it is more about using our logic and way of thinking to solve the problems we daily encounter. In a nutshell, our mission is to provide a sustainable learning platform that is easily accessible and help build a community with a positive attitude for those who are interested in mathematics.</p>
									<p>As a cyber media, we stand by these guidelines as our grip. We expect our team to read these guidelines carefully and think about how it might apply to their generated contents. The purpose of these guidelines is to give our team some sort of protections and fair guidance about what to avoid. Furthermore, these guidelines also give information to our readers about what to expect.</p>
									<p>However, the world we live in changes every second, sometimes in a dramatic way. In that case, these guidelines could be modified in the future as we see them fit. </p>
									<h3>Generated Contents</h3>
									<p>
										Fourier suggests the content creators to observe a topic as fairly and openly as feasible, though we also suggest they focus on one angle. We suggest them to explore and exploit mathematics as deeply as possible and express as much creativity in their generated contents. Still, we need to set some boundaries in order to stick to our mission.
									</p>
									<p>
										As mentioned above, one of our mission is to help build a community with a positive attitude for those who are interested in mathematics. Accordingly, we terribly disallow content that :
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>contains hoax, sadist, defamation, vulgarity, and related things;</li>
										<li>contains prejudice or hatred which offends ethnicity, religion, race, and inter-group relations;</li>
										<li>contains discrimination on the basis of gender or languages, or humiliate others.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Corrections</h3>
									<p>
										Fourier is responsible to deliver information to the readers as accurately as possible. In that case, our writers and editors are encouraged to do some fact checkings before the content is being published. On the contrary, we will correct all our factual errors, large or small, in our published contents as soon as we become aware of them. We deeply regret every error although we highly appreciate the integrity of the writer who volunteers correction of his or her own published contents.
									</p>
									<h3>Reader Comments</h3>
									<p>
										Fourier is highly interested in readers advice, criticism, and insights toward our contents as long as they deliver it in an appropriate way. We do not tolerate hatred comments, incoherence, profanity, discrimination, vulgarity, etc. We intend to provide a space where people can exchange intelligence that enhances the quality of our information. While we welcome strong opinions and criticism, direct attack against our team is unacceptable. We hope our readers to be kind to others and help us make our platforms a more comfortable place for everyone.
									</p>
									<h3>Plagiarism</h3>
									<p>
										Fourier extremely stands in the way of plagiarism. We gather information from a variety of sources, either the internet, books, journals, lecturers, even colleagues. We respect the anonymity of our sources when we are sure that they are credible, reliable, and wish not to be named. Conversely, it is obliged to specify the main sources. We will not tolerate our content creators who intentionally plagiarize in any form.
									</p>
									<h3>Social Media</h3>
									<p>
										Social media plays a fundamental role in the Fourier community. We use many social platforms such as Instagram (@fourier_media), LinkedIn (Fourier Media), Issuu (Fourier Magazine), and many more. These platforms help us to promote our work, reach wider audiences, even engage with our readers.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, social media also has its risks. Information travels quickly through the internet and we do not want any posts that could damage our reputation.Thus, we will do our best to treat others with respect and leave no room for harassment on social media. We hope our readers are doing so while they interact with us. Violations could be noted as online abuse.
